# NAME

sloane - lookup integer sequences, OEIS A-numbers, etc.

# SYNOPSIS

`sloane [--long] [-k KEYS] [-n N] [--all] [--monochrome] [--json] [--oeis] TERMS...`  
`sloane [--invert] --filter`  

# DESCRIPTION

`sloane` provides a command line interface to Sloane's OEIS (The On-Line
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). It can be used offline (the default)
as well as online (with the `--oeis` option). Local searches are faster
but a bit less flexible. A common way to use `sloane` is to search for
entries matching a sequence of consecutive terms:

    sloane 1,3,19,183,2371,38703

At the time of writing this would return

    S A006531 1,1,3,19,183,2371,38703,763099,17648823,468603091,14050842303,
    N A006531 Semiorders on n elements.

As shown here the default is to return the sequence (S) and the name (N)
fields. These are the only fields that are available in offline mode. In
online mode all fields are available. To select among the fields use the
`-k` option, or, to select all fields, use to `--long` option. The
following search would show the sequence, name, comments, and formula
fields:

    sloane -k SNCF --oeis 1,3,19,183,2371,38703

One can also lookup A-numbers or do a free text search; see the
**EXAMPLES** section.

The `--filter` option can be very useful when checking a large number of
sequences.  In this mode `sloane` reads standard input line-by-line, if
the sequence read is in the local database, then it is returned to
standard output; if not, it is ignored. This way one can quickly filter
out the sequences from the input that are in the local database. To be
concrete, assume that *FILE* contains one sequence per line. Then

    sloane --filter <FILE

returns the subset of the sequences in *FILE* that are in the local
database. To also lookup the names of those sequences one could run

    sloane --filter <FILE | sloane

The way this works is that if `sloane` is called without search terms
then it reads from standard input.

# OPTIONS

--oeis
:   Online search; lookup the provided terms in Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia
    of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

-k *KEYS*
:   Keys of fields to print (default: SN).

--long
:   Long format; print all fields.

-n *N*
:   Fetch at most this many entries (default: 5).

--all
:   Fetch all matching entries (equivalent to -n 999999).

--monochrome
:   Do not colorize the output. Useful when piping the output to another
    program.

--json
:   Output results is JSON format.

--invert
:   Return sequences *not* in the database (used with `--filter`).

--update
:   Update the local database.

--version
:   Print version information.

--help
:   Briefly describe the available options.

# EXAMPLES

Lookup A-numbers:

    $ sloane A000111 A000112
    
    S A000111 1,1,1,2,5,16,61,272,1385,7936,50521,353792,2702765,
    N A000111 Euler or up/down numbers: e.g.f. sec(x) + tan(x)..
    
    S A000112 1,1,2,5,16,63,318,2045,16999,183231,2567284,46749427,
    N A000112 Number of partially ordered sets ("posets") with n..

Lookup a sequence (limit to at most two results):

    $ sloane -n2 1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570,
    
    S A000110 1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570,4213597,
    N A000110 Bell or exponential numbers: number of ways to partition..
    
    S A192128 1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570,4213597,
    N A192128 Number of set partitions of {1, ..., n} that avoid..

Lookup a sequence generated by **hops**(1):

    $ hops 'y=1+integral(2*y^2-y);laplace(y)' | sloane

    S A000670 1,1,3,13,75,541,4683,47293,545835,7087261,102247563,
    N A000670 Fubini numbers: number of preferential arrangements of..

    S A034172 1,1,3,13,75,541,4683,47293,545835,7087261,102247563,
    N A034172 Nearest integer to n!/(2*log(2)^(n+1)).

Show the sequence, name, comments, and formula fields of the sequence
whose A-number is A006531:

    sloane -k SNCF --oeis id:A006531

Return at most 3 results of a free text search:

    sloane -n 3 --oeis "(2+2)-free posets"

`sloane` normally crops long lines to fit the widths of the terminal. If
this is unwanted, pipe the output through cat or less:

    sloane --long --oeis id:A000110 | less -R
