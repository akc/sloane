# NAME

sloane - lookup integer sequences, OEIS A-numbers, etc.

# SYNOPSIS

`sloane [-n N] [--all] [--oeis] TERMS...`  
`sloane [--invert] --filter`  
`sloane (--update|--version|--help)`   

# DESCRIPTION

`sloane` provides a command line interface to Sloane's OEIS (The On-Line
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). It can be used offline (the default)
as well as online (with the `--oeis` option).  The first time `sloane`
is used in offline mode the user will be asked to run
`sloane --update`. This will download
`https://oeis.org/{names.gz,stripped.gz}` and unpack them into
`.oeis-data/{names,stripped}` in the home directory. Alternatively, one
can do this by hand using `wget` and `gunzip`, say, if prefered.

A common way to use `sloane` is to search for entries matching a
sequence of consecutive terms:

    sloane 1,3,19,183,2371,38703

At the time of writing this would return

    {
      "trail": ["{1,3,19,183,2371,38703}"],
      "hops": "A006531",
      "name": "Semiorders on n elements.",
      "seq": [1,1,3,19,183,2371,38703,763099,17648823,468603091,...]
    }

The `--filter` option can be very useful when checking a large number of
sequences.  In this mode `sloane` expects input in the form returned by
**hops**(1). It reads standard input line-by-line, if the sequence in
the right hand side of the entry read is in the local database, then the
entry is returned to standard output; if not, it is ignored. This way
one can quickly filter out the sequences from the input that are in the
local database. To also lookup the names of those sequences one could
run

    sloane --filter <FILE | sloane

If the sequences one wishes to filter are not already in form returned
by `hops` then one may mold them into that form using `hops --tag`. See
the **EXAMPLES** section for more usage examples.

# OPTIONS

--oeis
:   Online search; lookup the provided terms in Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia
    of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

-n *N*
:   Fetch at most this many entries (default: 5).

--all
:   Fetch all matching entries (equivalent to -n 999999).

--filter
:   Filter out those sequences from standard input that are in the local
    database. The input is expected to be in the form returned by
    **hops**(1).

--invert
:   Return sequences *not* in the database (used with `--filter`).

--update
:   Update the local database.

--version
:   Print version information.

--help
:   Briefly describe the available options.

# EXAMPLES

Lookup A-numbers:

```
$ sloane A000111 A000112
{
  "hops": "A000111",
  "name": "Euler or up/down numbers: e.g.f. sec(x) + tan(x)...",
  "seq": [1,1,1,2,5,16,61,272,1385,7936,50521,353792,2702765,22368256,...]
}
{
  "hops": "A000112",
  "name": "Number of partially ordered sets (\"posets\") with n unlabeled elements.",
  "seq": [1,1,2,5,16,63,318,2045,16999,183231,2567284,46749427,...]
}
```
    
Lookup a sequence (limit to at most two results):

```
$ sloane -n2 1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570
{
  "trail": ["{1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570}"],
  "hops": "A000110",
  "name": "Bell or exponential numbers: number of ways to partition a set of n...",
  "seq": [1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570,4213597,27644437,...]
}
{
  "trail": ["{1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570}"],
  "hops": "A192127",
  "name": "Number of set partitions of {1, ..., n} that avoid 6-nestings.",
  "seq": [1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140,21147,115975,678570,4213596,27644383,...]
}
```

Lookup a sequence generated by **hops**(1):

```
$ hops 'y=1+integral(2*y^2-y);laplace(y)' | sloane
{
  "trail":["y=1+integral(2*y^2-y);laplace(y)"],
  "hops":"A000670",
  "name":"Fubini numbers: number of preferential arrangements of n labeled ...",
  "seq":[1,1,3,13,75,541,4683,47293,545835,7087261,102247563,1622632573,...]
}
{
  "trail":["y=1+integral(2*y^2-y);laplace(y)"],
  "hops":"A034172","name":"Nearest integer to n!/(2*log(2)^(n+1)).",
  "seq":[1,1,3,13,75,541,4683,47293,545835,7087261,102247563,1622632573,...]
}
```

Fetch the OEIS entry whose A-number is A006531:

```
sloane --oeis id:A006531
```

Return at most 3 results of a free text search:

```
sloane -n 3 --oeis "(2+2)-free posets"
```

# NOTES

Please use the `--oeis` option with some moderation as not to overburden
the OEIS-server; see [OEIS' policy on searching the database](
http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Policy_on_Searching_the_Database).
